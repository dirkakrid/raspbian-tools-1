These scripts have only been\r\ntested on openSUSE 12.3 distribution.\r\n\r\n## raspbian-backup\r\nThis is a script to backup your RaspberryPi sd card from a block device. The block device is usually mounted via an SD\r\ncard reader. After inserting the SD card into a reader, you can backup the entire RaspberryPi operating system by\r\nexecuting:\r\n\r\n    ./raspbian-backup /dev/sdd .\r\n\r\nThe above command is reading the /dev/sdd block device and making a backup of it into the current directory. The script \r\nwill create the backup image with a date timestamp. e.g. 2013-06-02_22h04m-raspberrypi.img\r\n\r\nIn order to know which block device was used for your card reader, you can verify by executing the command:\r\n\r\n    dmesg\r\nUsually you would see some messages from the kernel:\r\n\r\n    [230998.829647] usb 5-1: new high-speed USB device number 3 using xhci_hcd\r\n    [230998.842124] usb 5-1: New USB device found, idVendor=04cf, idProduct=9920\r\n    [230998.842131] usb 5-1: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=3\r\n    [230998.842135] usb 5-1: Product: CS8819B\r\n    [230998.842138] usb 5-1: Manufacturer: Myson Century, Inc.\r\n    [230998.842141] usb 5-1: SerialNumber: 000100000000\r\n    [230998.873431] Initializing USB Mass Storage driver...\r\n    [230998.873657] scsi12 : usb-storage 5-1:1.0\r\n    [230998.873845] usbcore: registered new interface driver usb-storage\r\n    [230998.873851] USB Mass Storage support registered.\r\n    [230999.874682] scsi 12:0:0:0: Direct-Access     Myson    SD/MMC/MS Reader 1.00 PQ: 0 ANSI: 0 CCS\r\n    [230999.875010] sd 12:0:0:0: Attached scsi generic sg4 type 0\r\n    [230999.875409] sd 12:0:0:0: [sdd] 7862272 512-byte logical blocks: (4.02 GB/3.74 GiB)\r\n    [230999.875638] sd 12:0:0:0: [sdd] Write Protect is off\r\n    [230999.875643] sd 12:0:0:0: [sdd] Mode Sense: 03 00 00 00\r\n    [230999.875874] sd 12:0:0:0: [sdd] Write cache: enabled, read cache: enabled, doesn't support DPO or FUA\r\n    [230999.879292]  sdd: sdd1 sdd2\r\n    [230999.880714] sd 12:0:0:0: [sdd] Attached SCSI removable disk\r\n\r\n## raspbian-chroot\r\nThis script helps in creating a chroot environment for your RaspberryPi backup image which has Raspbian installed as the\r\nOperating System.\r\n\r\nIt requires package qemu-linux-user and kpartx (or the equivalent for your distro of choice) to be installed. To start \r\nthe chrooted environment, execute it with the path to an exported Raspbian image:\r\n\r\n    ./raspbian-chroot 2013-06-02_22h04m-raspberrypi.img\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
